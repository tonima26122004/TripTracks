## Key Technologies

To be filled after deciding the codebase.

## Contributing Guidelines

1. **Pull the changes**: Always pull the changes so that your local codebase is always updated and there is no conflict when you're pushing the code.
```bash
git fetch -p
git pull origin <your-branch-name>
```

2. **Create a New Branch**: Do not make changes directly in the main branch. Every developer should create a branch to do their work. The branch name should be like `task-dev_name`. For example, if your name is John and you are assigned to do the footer, the branch name will be `footer-john`. Use the following command to create the branch.
   ```
   git checkout -b <your-branch-name>
   ```

3. **Make Changes and Commit**: Create the codebase, make the necessary changes, and commit your changes regularly.
   ```
   git add .
   git commit -m "<commit-message>"
   ```

4. **Push Your Branch**: Push the changes to the branch.
   ```
   git push -u origin <your-branch-name>
   ```

5. **Submit a Pull Request**: Create a pull request to merge your changes into the main repository. Provide a clear and concise description of your changes to help reviewers understand your contribution.
